Maintaining clean and consistent code is crucial for any developer. 

`husky`, `commitlint`, and `lint-staged` are three tools that can help you achieve this goal by automating pre-commit checks and linting.

## Husky: The Git Hook Manager

Husky is a Git hook manager that allows you to define scripts to run before, during, or after Git events like commit, push, or pull. 

This makes it ideal for automating pre-commit checks, such as linting, running tests, or formatting code.

### Key Features of Husky

- Customizable Hooks: Define custom scripts for various Git hooks (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push).

- Seamless Integration: Easily integrates with popular tools like `ESLint`, `Prettier`, and `Jest`.

- Improved Workflow: Automates routine tasks, freeing up time for actual development.

### Installation

```
npm i --save-dev husky
```

Husky init (recommended):

The init command simplifies setting up `husky` in a project. 

```
npx husky init
```

Defining Hooks:

Husky provides a .husky directory where you can define your Git hooks. For example, to run npm test before every commit, create a pre-commit file in .husky:

```
npm test
```


## commitlint

`commitlint` helps you enforce consistent commit message formatting by checking messages against a set of rules.

This ensures that your commit messages are clear, concise, and follow a standard format.


### Key Features of Commitlint

- Standardization: Enforces a standard format for commit messages, making it easier to track changes.

- Customization: Supports custom rules and configurations.

- Integration: Easily integrates with Git hooks via `husky`.

### Installation 

```
npm i -D @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
```

Then, add this to the husky hook

```
# .husky/pre-commit
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1
```

Add commitlint config

```js
// commitlint.config.js
const config = { extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"] };
export default config;
```

## lint-staged

`lint-staged` allows you to run linting only on the files that have been staged for the next commit. 

This speeds up your workflow by avoiding linting files that haven't changed.

### Key Features of `lint-Staged`

- Efficiency: Runs linters only on staged files, improving speed and performance.

- Flexibility: Supports any custom linting or formatting scripts.

- Integration: Works seamlessly with both Husky and popular linters like `ESLint` and `Prettier`.


### Installation

```
npm i -D lint-staged
```

To run linters on git staged files

```
# .husky/pre-commit
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

And config for running linters:

```json
// .lintstagedrc
{
  "*.ts": [
    "prettier --write",
    "eslint --fix ."
  ]
}
```

## Putting It All Together

By combining `husky`, `commitlint`, and `lint-staged`, you can create a powerful pre-commit workflow that ensures your code is always clean and consistent.

## Example Workflow

1. `husky` runs `lint-staged` before every commit.
2. `lint-staged` runs the appropriate linting commands for the staged files.
3. `commitlint` checks the commit message against the configured rules.
4. If all checks pass, the commit is allowed.

This workflow helps you catch errors early, maintain consistent code quality, and improve your overall development experience.

## Benefits

- Early Error Detection: Catch issues before they make it into the codebase.

- Improved Code Quality: Enforce consistent code standards and best practices.

- Enhanced Productivity: Automate repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing code.
