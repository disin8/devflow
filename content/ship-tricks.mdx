## Hidden Horizontal Overflow

In some cases, there might be an element that is literally wider than the document is, which might cause horizontal overflow scrolling. You could use a little JavaScript to help you find the culprit.

```
const documentWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach((node) => {
  if (node.offsetWidth > documentWidth) {
    console.log(node);
  }
});
```
