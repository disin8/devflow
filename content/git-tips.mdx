## ci skip

GitHub's `ci skip`: Your Shortcut to Streamlined Development

`ci skip` on GitHub lets you bypass the CI pipeline for specific commits, saving time when making small changes or testing experimental features.

### How it works:

- Add `ci skip` to your commit message (case-insensitive).
- Skips workflows triggered by `on: push` or `on: pull_request`.
- Subsequent commits won't be skipped automatically.

### When to use it:

- Minor, non-critical changes.
- Testing experimental features.
- Reverting changes quickly.

### Best practices:

- Communicate clearly in commit messages.
- Consider alternatives (e.g., separate branches).

### Examples of skip ci messages:

- [skip ci]
- [ci skip]
- [no ci]
- [skip actions]
- [actions skip]

`ci skip` is a valuable tool for streamlining development, but use it responsibly alongside best practices to maintain code quality and project integrity.
