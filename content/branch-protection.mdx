## Branch Protection rules

Head over to Settings > Branches and click on "Add branch protection rule" to establish rules for specific branches.

 These rules help maintain code quality and prevent accidental merges.

### Branch name pattern

Specify the name or regular expression for branches to which these rules will be applied. For instance, you can use "main" as a full branch name or a regex pattern like "qa/**/*" to match branches like "qa/foo/bar/foobar/hello-world".

### Required Status Checks

Choose the required status checks for your branch if you use them. These checks ensure that the code meets certain criteria before it can be merged. Examples include linting and type checking.

### Linear History

Enable linear history for easier readability of git history. This ensures a clean and straightforward commit history, making it easier to track changes and identify issues.
