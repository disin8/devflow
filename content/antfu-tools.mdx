## ni - use the right package manager

Are you tired of juggling different package managers, trying to remember which one to use for each project? Well, say hello to `ni` , your new best friend in the world of package management!

Think of [antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) as your personal package manager whisperer.

It automatically detects which package manager your project uses (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun) and runs the appropriate commands for you.
 
No more confusion, no more wasted time figuring things out. Just pure, streamlined efficiency.

### Why use

- **Simplify your workflow:** `ni` can be used for installing packages, running scripts, and managing dependencies, regardless of the package manager being used. This can help to streamline your workflow and make you more productive.

- **Boost your productivity:** No more context switching between different package managers. `ni` keeps you in the flow, getting things done faster.

- **Improve consistency:**  By using a single tool for all of your package management needs, you can help to ensure that your projects are consistent and that everyone on your team is using the same tools.

- **Increase efficiency:** `ni` can help you to avoid making mistakes by automatically detecting the correct package manager to use. This can save you time and effort in the long run.

### What can ni do?

- **Automatic package manager detection:** can automatically detect which package manager is being used for a project, based on the presence of a `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb` file.

- **Cross-package manager functionality:** `ni` can be used for a variety of tasks, including installing and uninstalling packages, running scripts, and managing dependencies, working seamlessly with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun.

- **Customization:** `ni` can be configured through a configuration file (~/.nirc) to set default behaviors, such as the preferred package manager.

### Getting Started

- **Installation:** To install `ni`, simply run: 

```
npm i -g @antfu/ni
```

- **Usage:** Once `ni` is installed, you can use it in your terminal like so:

```
ni <package-manager-command>
```

For example, to install the react package using `ni`, you would run:

```
ni react
```

Or for running project in development:

```
nr dev
```
